# ANTICOVID - A COVID-19 INFORMATRICS Initiative.

An **Indian**, *UNOFFICIAL* Infomatrics website for the ongoing **COVID-19** Pandemic.
In these rough times, every nations needs all the help they can possibly get and as a developer with
somewhat free time on my hands, I thought why not make something helpful.

The web application is made to be an one-stop solution for people seeking information and statistics
about the pandemic.

>Currently you can:
1. Search for resoures by district and city! [HERE](https://anticovid.herokuapp.com/essentials/)
2. See India's current statistics on an interactive map of India
3. See every state's current statistics
4. Chat with a bot to fetch quick information. (Ask for help by simply typing help!)
5. Play a quiz [HERE](https://anticovid.herokuapp.com/quiz/)
6. See what's on Twitter with twitter scrappinng [HERE](https://anticovid.herokuapp.com/social/)
7. See what's new with the news section [HERE](https://anticovid.herokuapp.com/news/)
8. See some facts [HERE](https://anticovid.herokuapp.com/facts/)
9. See what zone you are in [HERE](https://anticovid.herokuapp.com/zones/)
10. Share your feedback with me [HERE](https://anticovid.herokuapp.com/feedbacks/)

You can check out the website [HERE](https://anticovid.herokuapp.com/)

## Future Plans
1. Predict the curve
2. Scrape YT and Instagram for Videos and social content
3. Identify fake messages
4. Make a platform for doctor-patient online interaction
